# My Projects

## Analaysis of Rossmann Drugstore Sales
- There was a large dataset that was provided to my team and I. We analysed the entire dataset and came up with some quick questions that we could turn our focus to.
- Some of these questions included finding the stores which had the most customers, most profits and how sales were affected if there were holidays or not. 
- There was the initial data cleaning stage where we found the number of missing values in the dataset and decided if we should use imputation or to drop them.
- Exploratory Data Analaysis (EDA) was carried out to analyse trends in the dataset so that we could discover patterns or changes in sales during different periods of time.
- Bar charts, line graphs, time series plots and a correlation matrix were some of the data visualisation techniques used to gain valuable insights to our data, which gave us an indea on how to proceed to the next step.
- Machine Learing (ML) models such as Lasso and Ridge regressions were used for forecasting future stock prices.
- The regression models did give us a good R^2 value, but we managed to improve it further by implementing Decision trees and Random Forest models as well.
- At the end of the project, we essentially came up with a time series prediction model that forecasted the next 4 weeks of sales from its current date.
- We finally ended the project while a model outputting an R^2 value of 0.997.
